## Demo
You can try a publically hosted instance of uitabot on a trial basis. This public bot will automatically leave your server after a short while. If you want a permanent bot, keep reading for instructions on how to install your own instance.

## Requirements
* [Discord API key](https://discord.com/developers)
* [YouTube API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
* Python 3.8
* npm
* ffmpeg & ffprobe (version 4 or newer needed for some live streams)

## Linux Installation from Source
### Setup
```sh
# Tested on Ubuntu 18.04
sudo apt-get install git python3 python3-dev libffi-dev ffmpeg npm
git clone https://github.com/tedle/uitabot.git
cd uitabot/bot
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../web-client
npm install
```

### Configuration
Make a copy of the `config.example.json` in the root folder.
```sh
cp config.example.json config.json
```
Edit the new `config.json` file and fill in all the variables as needed. Documentation for every option can be found in [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md).

Next, in the Discord API bot settings, enable the **Server Members Intent**. This is necessary for the web front end to verify users as having access to a given server. If you are not using the web front end then this can be left disabled.

Finally, make sure the client URL that is being used is whitelisted in the Discord API OAuth settings for redirects.
### Building
#### Backend
```sh
cd bot
python3 uitabot.py
```
#### Frontend (development)
```sh
cd web-client
npm run dev
```
This will run a local web server that supports hot-reloading for development.
#### Frontend (production)
```sh
cd web-client
npm run build
```
This will output static asset files to the `web-client/build` folder that can then be served from any generic web server.
